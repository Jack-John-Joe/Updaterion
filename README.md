# Updaterion
Updaterion is my fast Windows Update system, which allows for easy obtaining of security updates without the hassle of the normal Windows Update system.
# How it works
Back in Windows 98, automatic updates were planned. Microsoft began working on this partially, but never fully made it and left remnants. These remnants were removed in Windows XP and replaced by the Windows Update Service. Editing the Legacy Update Service from Windows 98 correctly, you can get it to trigger the new Windows Update Service. 
# Instructions
Download the source code and extract it.
Run "main.bat" to start the update.
If you get a failed to update screen, then wait for the next version of the app. App is updated weekly.
