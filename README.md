# Updaterion
Updaterion is my fast Windows Update system, which allows for easy obtaining of security updates without the hassle of the normal Windows Update system.
# How it works
Back in Windows 98, automatic updates were planned. Microsoft began working on this, but it was never implemented. Remnants of it were removed in Windows XP and replaced by Windows Update. Taking advantage of the similarity between the old Windows Update, we can get it to update from our own servers and the Microsoft Update Catalog
# Instructions
Download the source code and extract it.
Run "main.bat" to start the update.
If you get a failed to update screen, then wait for the next version of the app. App is updated weekly.
